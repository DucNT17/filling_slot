Overload / Reverse Current: The rectifier has a 63 A fuse in the negative output DC bus. This fuse is not customer replaceable. The rectifier can be plugged into or pulled out of a shelf while operating, without damage or opening the fuse.\\n2. Current Limiting: The rectifier has a current limit function. The current limit point can be set between the range of 4 A to 21 A, adjustable via the controller. The current limit accuracy is ±1 A when the output voltage ranges from 42 VDC to 58 VDC. Below 42 VDC the current will fold back to a lower value.\\n3. Advanced Current Limit Function: The rectifier has an advanced Current Limit Function. When a short circuit occurs at the rectifier output terminals, the rectifier will keep its output current at a value below the maximum current limit set point. This function effectively protects the rectifier and the equipment connected to the rectifier. When the short circuit fault is cleared, the rectifier will automatically restore back to normal operation.\\n4. High Voltage Shutdown:\\n\\n1. Adjustable Control: If rectifier output voltage exceeds an adjustable preset value and the rectifier is delivering more than 10 % of its rated current, the rectifier shuts down. (Adjustable from 56 VDC to 59 VDC via the controller. The restart hysteresis is 0.5 V ±0.2 V.)\\n\\nThe rectifier then restarts and a HVSD restart timer starts (time value configurable via the controller, factory default is 5 minutes). If output voltage again exceeds the high voltage shutdown value before the HVSD restart timer expires, the rectifier shuts down and locks out. Manual restart is then required (by turning power to the rectifier off or by removing the rectifier, waiting until the LEDs on the rectifier extinguish, then turning power to the rectifier on or re-inserting the rectifier). If the rectifier does not experience a high voltage condition before the HVSD restart timer expires, the restart circuit is reset.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVertiv | NetSure Rectifier Module User Manual (UM1R481000e3 / 11MB4705YO) | Rev.
