- Easily monitor and adjust system parameters with a simple, graphic user interface accessed through an on-board color display or web pages supported by all major browsers.

- Numerous connectivity options that support integration into a wide variety of networks – IPv4, IPv6, Modbus, SNMP, TL1, EEM, YDN23 and dual network port option for permanent and local craft port connections.

- Leverage advanced battery and generator management controls, including soft start, time controls, starter battery check with recharge, bad-grid equalization recovery, current limiting, fuel monitoring with theft alarms and support for multiple battery technologies, including lithium.

- Rapidly turn-up system with easily uploaded/ downloaded pre-programmed configuration files.

- Decrease energy costs by effectively managing multiple energy sources such as generators and solar panels.

## Description

The NetSure Control Unit (NCU) is an advanced controller designed for a wide range of DC power applications, enabling remote monitoring and control of modern communication sites. The factory-installed (standard) or field-added NCU is backward compatible with existing NetSure power systems, controlling all aspects of the power chain, including AC mains, DC power plant, battery backup, diesel generator, and the local site environment. The addition of optional interface boards enables the user to access an even greater set of site parameters.

Network element management support for data communication is also available via standard protocols, such as SNMP version 2 or 3, or Modbus. In addition, Modbus device integration for many industry standard monitoring devices is now possible with the versatile NCU controller.

Patented Intelligent Load Management from Vertiv enables you to see power usage down to the fuse or circuit breaker level. To prevent site overload, load levels of each rack can be measured in relation to rack capacity. Rack load monitoring requires optional system distribution measurement devices for the fuse or circuit breaker positions.

Battery management features include temperature compensation, thermal runaway management, recharge current limit, reserve time prediction, and optional midpoint monitoring. Battery testing options include scheduled battery testing and short duration battery testing. Thresholds for battery current measurement, detailed alarms, inventory management and three LVD levels can be programmed easily through the controller. Control of rectifiers (24V, 48V and 400V) and converters (24V, 48V, 400V and solar) is possible in this convenient pluggable module.

Expanded information and alarm data can be monitored or controlled via password protected and encrypted web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari.
