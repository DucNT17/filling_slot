### Description

The eSure™ C400/48-3000e3 high-efficiency converter is designed to operate from a nominal 400V DC or 200VAC source to provide nominal -48V DC load power, which is adjustable to application needs. The C400/48-3000e3 is a constant power converter designed with the latest patented switch mode technology, using DSP (Digital Signaling Processor) functionality for efficient operation.

For a higher load capacity, converters can be connected in parallel, and intelligent control can be added with the help of a separate controller.
