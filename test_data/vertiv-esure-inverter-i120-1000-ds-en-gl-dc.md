## Description

The eSure™ Inverter I120-1000 is based on Vertiv's long experience from both highly reliable DC power and UPS systems, combining the best technologies from two worlds. The result is a power dense dual input (AC and DC) inverter with zero transfer time to keep important equipment running at any time. With the dual conversion topology of this inverter we can ensure that the load is running in the most efficient way and the rectifier investment can be kept to a minimum – supporting only battery recharge and DC loads.

The eSure Inverter offers a highly reliable, modular AC back-up solution that can be paralleled in steps of 1000 watts / 1000 VA. In terms of back-up capability, it can provide many hours of reserve time by utilizing the same battery bank as the DC plant. eSure Inverters can be factory configured in integrated Vertiv™ NetSure™ Inverter systems together with eSure™ rectifiers, where the entire system is controlled and monitored by a single NCU control unit. A stand-alone NetSure™ Inverter system is also available that can be field-added to an existing DC power system from any vendor.
