# Safety Precautions

To reduce the chance of accident, please read the safety precautions very carefully before operation. The "Caution, Notice, Warning, Danger" in this book do not represent all the safety points to be observed, and are only supplement to various safety points. Therefore, the installation and operation personnel must be strictly trained and master the correct operations and all the safety points before actual operation.

When operating Emerson products, the safety rules in the industry, the general safety points and special safety instructions specified in this book must be strictly observed.

## Electrical Safety

### I. Hazardous voltage

⚠️ Danger

Some components of the power system carry hazardous voltage in operation. Direct contact or indirect contact through moist objects with these components will result in fatal injury.

Safety rules in the industry must be observed when installing the power system. The installation personnel must be licensed to operate high voltage and AC power.

In operation, the installation personnel are not allowed to wear conductive objects such as watches, bracelets, bangles, rings.

When water or moisture is found on the Subrack, turn off the power immediately. In moist environment, precautions must be taken to keep moisture out of the power system.

"Prohibit" warning label must be attached to the switches and buttons that are not permitted to operate during installation.

⚠️ Danger

High voltage operation may cause fire and electric shock. The connection and wiring of AC cables must be in compliance with the local rules and regulations. Only those who are licensed to operate high voltage and AC power can perform high voltage operations.

### II. Tools

⚠️ Warning

In high voltage and AC operation, special tools must be used. No common or self-carried tools should be used.

### III. Thunderstorm

⚠️ Danger

Never operate on high voltage, AC, iron tower or mast in the thunderstorm.

In thunderstorms, a strong electromagnetic field will be generated in the air. Therefore the equipment should be well earthed in time to avoid damage by lightning strikes.

## IV. ESD

![ESD icon] Notice

The static electricity generated by the human body will damage the static sensitive elements on PCBs, such as large-scale ICs. Before touching any plug-in board, PCB or IC chip, ESD wrist strap must be worn to prevent body static from damaging the sensitive components. The other end of the ESD wrist strap must be well earthed.

## V. Short circuit

![Danger icon] Danger

During operation, never short the positive and negative poles of the DC distribution unit of the system or the non-grounding pole and the earth. The power system is a constant voltage DC power equipment, short circuit will result in equipment burning and endanger human safety.

Check carefully the polarity of the cable and connection terminal when performing DC live operations.

As the operation space in the DC distribution unit is very tight, please carefully select the operation space.

Never wear a watch, bracelet, bangle, ring, or other conductive objects during operation.

Insulated tools must be used.

In live operation, keep the arm muscle tense, so that when tool connection is loosened, the free movement of the human body and tool is reduced to a minimum.

## VI. Dangerous energy

![Warning icon] Warning

More than 240VA system capacity, keep away from hazardous energy and avoid bridge connection.

## Battery

![Danger icon] Danger

Before any operation on battery, read carefully the safety precautions for battery transportation and the correct battery connection method.

Non-standard operation on the battery will cause danger. In operation, precautions should be taken to prevent battery short circuit and overflow of electrolyte. The overflow of electrolyte will erode the metal objects and PCBs, thus causing equipment damage and short circuit of PCBs.

Before any operation on battery, pay attention to the following points:

- Remove the watch, bracelet, bangle, ring, and other metal objects on the wrist.
- Use special insulated tools.
- Use eye protection device, and take preventive measures.

To inspect the equipment, you should open the packing case, take out the packing list and check against the packing list that the equipment is correct and complete. Make sure that the equipment is delivered intact.

### Cables

The cable should be selected in accordance with relevant industry standards.

It is recommended to use the RVVZ cables as AC cables. The cable should reach at least +70°C temperature durability. With cable length shorter than 30 meters, the Cross-Sectional Area (CSA) calculation should be based on the current density of 3.5A/mm2. The suggested CSA value is no less than the Table 2-1.

| AC MCB rated current | Max. AC input current | Min cable CSA | Max cable CSA |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 125A                 | 74A                   | 25mm2         | 50mm2         |


The CSA of DC cable depends on the current flowing through the cable and the allowable voltage drop. To select the battery cable CSA, see Table 2-2, select the DC load cable CSA according to the Table 2-3.

| Battery MCB rated current | Max. battery current | Min cable CSA | Max cable length( volt drop: 0.5V with max. CSA) |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 125A                      | 105A                 | 35mm2         | 6m                                               |


Note:
1. The specs are applicable at ambient temperature of 25°C.

Chapter 4 Troubleshooting 15


This chapter describes the handling of alarms, as well as the routine maintenance of the system during system daily operation.

The maintenance personnel must have adequate knowledge about the subrack power system.

> Note
> 1. The maintenance must be conducted under the guidance of related safety regulations.
> 2. Only trained personnel with adequate knowledge about the subrack power system shall maintain the inner part of the subrack.

## 4.1 Controller Alarms And Fault Handling

The controller alarms are classified into three types: major alarm, observation alarm and no alarm.

Major alarm: This type of alarms have strong impacts on the system performance. Whenever these alarms are generated, users are supposed to handle them immediately. The red major alarm indicators will be on.

Observation: When this type of alarm is raised, the system maintains normal output for a while. If the alarm occurs during watch time, it should be handled immediately. If the alarm occurs during non- watch- time, handle it during watch time. The yellow observation alarm indicators will be on.

No alarm: If alarms are set as 'no alarm' by the users, when these alarms occur, the green alarm indicators will be on and the system works normally.

If an unnecessary alarm occurs during the operation of the controller, set it according to the following method.

Take the alarm of 'Rect Lost' for example:

For M221S/M222S controller: MAIN MENU —> Settings —> Alarm—> Alarm Control—> Clear—> For the submenu of "Clear", you can select "Rect Lost" to clear corresponding alarm.

For M225S controller: Settings->Clear. For the submenu of 'Clear', you can select 'Rect Lost' to clear corresponding alarm.

The handling methods of normal alarms are given in Table 4-1.

| 1     | Mains Failure   | If the failure does not last long, the battery will power the load. If the cause is unknown or the failure lasts too long, a diesel generator is needed. Before using the generator power to supply the subrack power system, it is suggested to run the generator at least five minutes to minimize the impact on the subrack power system                                                                                                         |
| 2     | DC Voltage High | Check if the DC over-voltage value is too low. If yes, change the value. A mild over-voltage does not affect the system operation. However, the rectifiers will stop working operation when the mains voltage is more than target. If the mains voltage is above the DC over-voltagevalue, the mains grid should be improved                                                                                                                        |
| 3     | DC Voltage Low  | Check if the DC Under- voltage point is too high. If yes, change the value. When the mains voltage is lower than set up, the output power of the rectifiers will be derated. And if lowerthan set up, the rectifiers will stop working. If the mains voltage is under the DC under-voltage value, themains grid should be improved                                                                                                                  |
| 4     | SPD alarm       | Check the SPD condition. If the SPD is damaged, replace it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 5     | DC Volt High    | Check the DC over-voltage value through the controller. If the setting value is inappropriate, correct it. Otherwise, find out the rectifier that has caused the alarm: 1. Ensure that the batteries can operate normally. 2. Switch off the DC input of all rectifiers. 3. Power on the rectifiers one by one. 4. If the over-voltage protection is triggered when a certain rectifier is powered on, that rectifier is the faulty one. Replace it |

### C400/48-3000e3 Replacement

Rectifier modules can be inserted or removed with power applied (hot swappable).

#### Note:

Each rectifier module locks into a module mounting shelf by means of a latch located on the bottom of the module. The latch and rectifier module handle are interactive. Pushing the handle up into the module's front panel causes the latch to extend to the locking position; pulling the handle down out from the module's front panel causes the latch to retract.

⚠️ DANGER!

Take care when removing a rectifier module that was in operation, as rectifier module surfaces could be very hot.

⚠️ WARNING!

To prevent damage to the latching mechanism, ensure the handle is in the open position when installing or removing a rectifier module. NEVER hold the handle in the closed position when installing a rectifier module into a shelf.

### Procedure

Refer to Figure 4-5 as this procedure is performed.

1. Performing this procedure may activate external alarms. Do one of the following. If possible, disable these alarms. If these alarms cannot be easily disabled, notify the appropriate personnel to disregard any alarms associated with this system while this procedure is performed.
[[__PAGE_25__]]


Chapter 4  Troubleshooting  19

2. Loosen the captive screw on the module's handle. Pull the handle down out from the module's front panel (this will also retract the latch mechanism).

3. Grasp the handle and pull firmly to remove the module from the shelf.

4. Place the replacement rectifier module into the mounting position without sliding it in completely.

5. Loosen the captive screw on the module's handle. Pull the handle down out from the module's front panel (this will also retract the latch mechanism).

6. Push the module completely into the shelf.

7. Push the handle up into the module's front panel. This will lock the module securely to the shelf.  Tighten the captive screw on the handle.

8. Certain functions (i.e. rectifier current limit, rectifier addressing) may require adjustment when adding or replacing a rectifier module.

9. After the rectifier modules are physically installed in the mounting shelf(s), they are ready for operation immediately after power is supplied to them. Verify that the rectifiers are operating normally.

10. Enable the external alarms, or notify appropriate personnel that this procedure is finished.

11. Ensure that there are no local or remote alarms active on the system.

## 4.2.2 Rectifier Fan Replacement

Each Rectifier uses a fan (P/N:32010485) for cooling. If fan replacement should become necessary, perform the following procedure.

Refer to Figure 4-5 as this procedure is performed.

⚠️ WARNING!

In a system with NO redundant Rectifier, battery must have sufficient reserve to power the load(s) while the Rectifier is removed for fan replacement.
